Here is a set of tentative topics to be covered in the summer workshop on *Collaborations with Git*.

1. Grow the lifecycle of research with Git.
    1. Build your work on top of other team members' work (like shared tools), and boost the research group's work efficiency by passing code and documents from one generation to another.
    2. Extend collaborations and communicate your research result with the scientific community by sharing your code and documents.
    3. Work in parallel with people (paper writing and coding on one set of programs).

2. Git workflow in the context of collaboration.
    1. CQuIC@GitHub and other repository offers (GitLab, Docker images and GitHub pages).
    2. Basic concept: fork, clone, merge, rebase, conflict resolving, squash and issuing.

3. Git usage in CQuIC -- make it feasible and easy.
    1. With people who knows or would like to learn git.
    2. With people who don't know and don't want to learn git. Real example: writing papers with professors and other students in CQuIC. Some automation scripts can be found on Xiaodong Qi's github [script repo](https://github.com/i2000s/scripts). Optional: submodule might be used.
